Vagrant SugarCRM
================

This is the vagrant file for setting up an Ubuntu server with SugarCRM.

To install, from the current folder run:
```
vagrant up
```
Once complete, open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/sugarcrm](http://localhost:8080/sugarcrm) to run the setup wizard.

* Note 1: You may want to change the port forwarding if there are any conflicts with other apps that you have running on the same port.
* Note 2: The default database user is `root` with password `vagrant`.
